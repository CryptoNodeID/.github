# Node Activation

## Get HMND

Before you continue, you will need to buy some HMND to activate your node.\
You can buy it from [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com/r/rf/2Kxd6rb), or you can [contact me](https://t.me/CryptoNodeID) to buy very small amount of it.

## Scan QR using your phone

Once  you've done the installation, your launcher will show QR like below (QR censored for security purpose).
